MorfiTime is an application that facilitates reservations at gastronomic establishments.

Using MorfiTime you will be able to make reservations at all the gastronomic establishments attached to the application.

## How does the app work?
Once you have the account created, you can select the place you prefer and then make a reservation at the available times and sectors of the place.

With MorfiTime it is no longer necessary to call to the place, just simply make your reservation and once the reservation was confirmed by the place, you will receive a push notification to let you know that the appointment has been reserved.

Even if the place does not confirm your reservation, you will also receive a push notification on your smartphone.
